<p>Best of Reddit is an image aggregator that uses the Reddit API to scrape top-rated photos off of several subreddits. I made this for personal use to easily gather wallpapers and interesting photos from a few subreddits that I follow, because I didn&#8217;t want to manually check different boards to find photos. Currently, it pulls the 3 most-voted photos and updates the photos every 6 hours from 3 subreddits. Hovering over a photo allows you to see the vote count, the subreddit, the author, and a link to the live post.</p>
